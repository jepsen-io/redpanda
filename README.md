# jepsen.redpanda

Tests for the Redpanda distributed queue.

## Installation

## Usage

`lein run test`

## FAQ

If you're running in containers Redpanda may fail to start, citing a need to
increase `/proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr` on the host OS--individual containers can't
alter it themselves. Try

```
sudo sh -c 'echo 10000000 > /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr'
```
